# Merge branch
1. **Select the Target Branch:**
  - You need to decide the branch into which you want to merge changes.
  - For instance, if you're on a **feature branch** and want to bring those changes into the **master** branch, you'd switch to the **master branch** (```git checkout master```).
2. **Start the Merge:**
  - Use the ```git merge``` command followed by the branch name you want to merge into the current branch.
  - For instance, if you're on the _master branch_ and want to merge changes from a _feature branch_ named **"new-feature,"** you'd use  
    ```git merge new-feature```
